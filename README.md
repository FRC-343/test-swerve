WARNING THIS IS NOT COMP VIABLE CODE. 

This is our solution to a "budget swerve" it only uses the built in encoder on a NEO motor for turning and has a cim motor as drive. 

As of right now it is only robot oriented and does not self zero meaning you have to manually reset the zeros.
It does have Limit switches in the code but these are unused. 
This also does not have the ability to drive and spin the body it is one or the other.
